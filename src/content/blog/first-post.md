# Hello MDX!

This is my first blog post using **MDX** with Astro. MDX is a powerful format that lets you write JSX in your Markdown content.

## Why Astro?

Astro is an excellent static site generator with a few key benefits:

1. **Performance** - Astro sends zero JavaScript to the client by default
2. **Component Islands** - Use your favorite UI components but only hydrate what's needed
3. **Easy to learn** - If you know HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript, you're ready to go

## Code example

Here's a simple JavaScript example:

```js
// Simple function
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('Astro'));
```

## What's next?

In upcoming posts, we'll explore:

- Setting up a blog with collections
- Adding dynamic features
- Optimizing images
- Deploying your Astro site
