# About Hospitality.dev

## The Mission

Hospitality.dev exists at the intersection of two passions: technology and hospitality. 
This blog explores how these worlds collide, creating better experiences for both guests and service providers.

Our mission is to share insights, tutorials, and industry perspectives that help bridge the gap between
technical innovation and exceptional service delivery.

## The Technology

This site is built with modern, performance-focused technologies:

- [Astro](https://astro.build) - A modern static site generator that delivers incredible speed
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) - Markdown with JSX support for rich, interactive content
- Custom CSS - No heavy frameworks, just clean, efficient styling

The design draws inspiration from minimalist blogs like 
[Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net) 
and [MGX.me](https://mgx.me), focusing on readability and content.

## The Author

This blog is written by a technologist with deep roots in the hospitality industry,
